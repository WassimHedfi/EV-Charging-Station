# EV-Charging-Station

The aim of the project was to provide a scalable and reliable EV charging system prototype. To achieve this goal, we designed, constructed and tested a fully automated system that utilizes a line follower robot with PID regulation. This robot navigates a designated path and autonomously stops at the charging station when needed. Once at the charging station, the robot makes mechanical contact with it and initiates the charging process. The robot resumes its path once the battery state of charge (SoC) reaches a certain level. Throughout the charging and the navigation processes, the system continuously takes appropriate measurements to ensure optimal performance and efficiency.
